### 👋🏾 Hi There

I'm Neha, a Security Product Manager at NVIDIA. I develop security products and run programs that focus on securing the future of accelerated computing. I am passionate about making technology more accessible and transparent -- cybersecurity is a massive part of this passion! 

I graduated in May 2022 with a dual degree in [Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) and [Business Administration](https://haas.berkeley.edu/) through the [Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology](https://met.berkeley.edu) (M.E.T.) Program.

I'm from [Southwest Virginia](https://visitswva.org/) and am passionate about bridging the gap between technology and accessibility. I've seen the impact that technological gentrification and technological illteracy has on my community. As a result, I've dedicated much of my academic and professional career in exploring emerging technologies and how they can impact different use cases like my own community. I am also passionate about making technology more transparent by building security and privacy measures in every day tools.
