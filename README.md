### 👋🏾 Hi There

I'm Neha, a Senior at UC Berkeley passionate about making technology more accessible and transparent. 

I'm currently pursuing a dual degree in [Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) and [Business Administration](https://haas.berkeley.edu/) through the [Management, Entrepreneurship, and Technology](https://met.berkeley.edu) (M.E.T.) Program.

I'm from [Southwest Virginia](https://visitswva.org/) and am passionate about bridging the gap between technology and accessibility. I've seen the impact that technological gentrification and technological illteracy has on my community. As a result, I've dedicated much of my academic and professional career in exploring emerging technologies and how they can impact different use cases like my own community. I am also passionate about making technology more transparent by building security and privacy measures in every day tools.

Currently, I'm a Software Engineering Intern at Facebook on People Data Privacy working to build more transparency with Facebook users and the application itself. Previously, I was a Software Engineering Intern at NVIDIA on Product Security where I built products to enable NVIDIA engineers to secure their programs and offerings. More specifically, I worked on [Morpheus](https://developer.nvidia.com/morpheus-cybersecurity), a cloud-native cybersecurity framework to identify, capture and take action on threats and anomalies that were previously impossible to identify.
